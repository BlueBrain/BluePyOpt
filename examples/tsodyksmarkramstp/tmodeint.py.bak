"""Tsodyks-Markram model ODEINT.
This module contains functions to numerically integrate the Tsodyks-Markram
model. The current implementation is a port of an Igor Pro (WaveMetrics)
routine, written by Rodrigo Perin with the help of Raphael Holzer. Many thanks
to Misha Tsodyks and Henry Markram for their support during all development
stages.
